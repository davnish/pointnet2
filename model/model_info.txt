pointnet2_25_4096_2 : without query ball, 600 epochs, model overfitted need to add some regularization
poitnnet2_25_4096_3 : with query ball, 200 epochs, droupout after this
pointnet2_25_4096_4 : with query ball, 200 epochs, radius = 3
pointnet2_25_4096_5 : with query ball, 200 epochs, radius = 1

pointnet_25_4096_2  : 600 epochs, model is overfitted
pointnet_25_4096_3  : 200 epochs, step_size reduced from 100 to 50 gave bad results
